# Positional encoding - Lian Jiang, 2024

## System requirements
* The current code only supports the Windows system. 
* The Python version used in this code is 64-bit Python3.12.2.
* The package required in this code is included in the requirement.txt. 

## Introduction
The goal of this work is to design a learnable positional encoding method using Pytorch.

## Input dataset
The input dataset is a dummy dataset generated using Python code.

## Methods
The steps used to create the learnable positional encoding method are as follows:
1) Define the parameters needed in this code, such as the length of the sequences and the number of samples.
2) Create a dummy dataset using the class DummyData.
3) Craete the model module in which the learnable positional encoding embedding layer is created.
4) Initialize the model.
5) Create the model training loop process.
